/**
 * Clio HDF5 VOL Connector — pass-through, native-authoritative.
 *
 * EVERY operation is delegated to the native VOL, which owns the file: the
 * on-disk HDF5 image is written synchronously and is the source of truth, so
 * standard tools read it live and CLIO can be removed without losing data.
 * On top of that, whole-dataset H5Dwrite/H5Dread transfers of flat datatypes
 * are additionally MIRRORED into the CTE tier as chunked blobs, and hyperslab /
 * point reads can be served from that mirror (serve-only; a miss falls back to
 * native). The cache is an accelerator, never an authority: any doubt about
 * whether it matches the file resolves by invalidating it and re-reading native.
 *
 * If the CLIO runtime is unreachable, or CLIO_VOL_CACHE=0 is set, the connector
 * degrades to a pure pass-through and remains correct. See README.md for
 * configuration.

     Filesystem::Filesystem -> CLIO_CTE_CLIENT_INIT()); without this the CTE
     client singleton is unbound and the first AsyncGetOrCreateTag segfaults.
     Config comes from CLIO_SERVER_CONF, same as the runtime.

     Returns nullptr when the runtime is unreachable. Callers MUST check: the
     attach result was previously discarded, so an absent runtime faulted inside
     H5Fcreate. There is always a correct fallback -- pass everything through to
     the native VOL -- because the native file is authoritative and the CTE tier
     is a performance layer, not a correctness one. */
  /* Teardown guard. HDF5 registers H5_term_library() with atexit(), so an
     application that leaves a file open at exit closes it AFTER the point
     where CLIO has torn its transports down -- LAMMPS' h5md dump is one, and
     a stock binary cannot be changed to close earlier. The close path writes
     the coherence stamp, and sending that task through a destroyed transport
     faults inside Transport::Send with this=0x0.

     The flag is local to this translation unit ON PURPOSE. Asking
     CLIO_RUNTIME_MANAGER whether it has finalized does not work and is worse
     than useless: that accessor publishes a lazily constructed singleton, so
     during exit it hands back a BRAND-NEW RuntimeManager whose
     finalize_complete_ is false -- observed as two distinct manager pointers,
     the real one finalizing while the VOL allocated a second and sailed past
     the check into the same crash.

     Ordering is what makes the flag correct: HDF5 registers its handler when
     the library initialises, which necessarily precedes the VOL being loaded
     and attached here, and atexit runs handlers in reverse. Ours is therefore
     set before H5_term_library() closes anything. A close that happens
     normally (an explicit H5Fclose before exit) still takes the full path.
     Skipping the stamp is the documented fail-closed fallback: the native VOL
