 * `s` is an input already standardised as (raw - mean) / std; `lo` and `hi`
 * are the .nnwt feature bounds in the same units. Identity inside [lo, hi].
 * Beyond either bound the excess is compressed logarithmically:
 * hi + log1p(s - hi), and symmetrically below. Continuous at the bound,
 * strictly monotone everywhere, so order between out-of-range chunks is kept
 * while their magnitude is not.
 *
 * Why not the identity, which is what upstream does: the shipped weights were
 * fit on mad <= 0.50 and second_deriv <= 1.006, and LAMMPS float32 state
 * presents mad = 39 and second_deriv = 99 -- 365 and 467 training sigmas out.
 * Fed raw, those drive the hidden activations to ~250 and the ratio head's raw
 * output to +24 against a cap at 2.04 (position predicted 25x, delivered
 * 1.06x). Worse, they make the trunk's response to ANY weight change
 * asymmetric: a step that moves an in-range chunk's prediction by 0.5 sigma
 * moves an out-of-range chunk's by 5-7 sigma, so every in-range SGD call on a
 * mixed stream kicks the out-of-range predictions across the whole output
 * range. Under this bound the same chunk lands at ~9 sigma instead of 365,
 * and the asymmetry is gone.
 *
 * Why not a hard clip: velocity (mad 1.53) and position (mad 38.9) would both
 * clip to 0.50 and become the same input with different targets.
 *
 * The bounds ship IN the .nnwt (v2, "feature bounds") and were previously
 * loaded and ignored. Applied identically by every inference kernel and by
 * SGD -- one function -- so training never sees a different input than the
 * prediction was made from. The weights themselves are untouched.
