 * Ports NeuroPress's nn_gpu.cu (nnFusedInferenceKernel, nnSGDKernel) to
 * Clio's own weight layout. Weights, EMA gradient state, and uncertainty
 * log-variance all live in device memory for the lifetime of the handle --
 * the host never touches the decision data, matching the original design.
 * Per-sample activations and gradient accumulators are cached in a
 * persistent device scratch buffer (allocated once, not per-call) rather
 * than shared memory, trading a little device memory for a simpler,
 * easier-to-verify kernel; the numerical algorithm itself is unchanged from
 * upstream (same clamps, same constants, same order of operations).

/**
 * Per-flow EMA gradient buffer.
 *
 * Upstream splits its online-learning state: weights and sgd_call_count are
 * global, but the EMA gradient lives in a per-CompContext buffer. That split is
 * load-bearing -- the weight step is `w -= step * EMA[...]`, not the raw
 * gradient -- so whatever the buffer is scoped to is what learning is smoothed
 * over. Clio reproduces the split: shared weights and call count, separate EMA.
 *
 * The SCOPE is an approximation. Upstream's buffer belongs to a pool slot taken
 * per compression call, so gradient history follows the slot and one slot mixes
 * unrelated flows; here it belongs to the thread for its lifetime, so history
 * is continuous per worker. The two agree on the math and the split but bucket
 * samples differently, and can reach different weights on the same concurrent
 * workload. Neither is more correct -- upstream's bucketing depends on which
 * slot happens to be free, so it does not define a deterministic per-flow EMA
 * either. Thread scope is the closest stable analogue at this layer, where
 * there is no CompContext to attach to.
 *
 * Two consequences of the wider scope, neither load-bearing today: the buffer
 * count is unbounded where upstream's is capped at 9, and each is cudaMalloc'd
 * on first use and never freed, so thread churn would leak 54 KB a time.
 * Train() is reached only from the runtime's fixed worker pool.
 *
 * Registered globally so a model reload can zero every live buffer, matching
 * upstream's resetAllSGDEMABuffers(). See Registry() for why it is never torn
 * down.

   *    concurrent workers."

   * `applied` flag whose only consumer was an HLOG(kDebug) field, paid for
   * with a full host synchronize on every chunk the model learned from.
