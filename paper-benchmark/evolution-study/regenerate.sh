# <workload>:<evolution run>:<k31 run>:<fig3 field>. LAMMPS has no fig3 --
# atom coordinates have no grid to localize activity on, hence no .slices.npz
# and no field either.
#
# THE FIELD IS NOT RECORDED IN THE .npz. Those files hold five arrays named
# s0..s4 and nothing else, so which variable the top row shows cannot be
# recovered from them -- it is pinned here instead. Only the BOTTOM row reads
# it (from blocks.csv.gz); the top row is the cache verbatim. The values below
# were recovered by matching the committed figures' bottom row against every
# field in blocks.csv.gz: vpic cbx and cby are identical there and the Weibel
# signature is cby; warpx Bx/By/Bz/Ex/Ey are likewise identical, and Ex is the
# laser polarization.
# fig4's --field picks which variable panel (a) opens on; fig3's picks the
# bottom row. One field per workload serves both. LAMMPS has no fig3 but its
# fig4 still needs a field, hence `position` rather than `-`.
