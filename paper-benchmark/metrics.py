"""Aggregate one paper-benchmark cell into metrics.json, and normalise its
per-chunk rows into results.csv.

    ./metrics.py <cell-dir> [<cell-dir> ...]
    ./metrics.py --table warpx/*/            # one line per cell, for eyeballing

A cell is <workload>/<config>/, as run_paper.sh writes it. Everything here is
derived from files that already exist -- blobs.csv, selection.csv, config.json
-- so it can be re-run at any time without touching the GPU, and re-running it
cannot change what was measured.

BLOB NAMES CARRY THE COORDINATES, AND NOT IN ONE FORMAT. Three of the four
workloads run in situ and name a blob for the step it came from; Nyx runs
through replay and names it for the DUMP INDEX, because the replay driver only
ever sees files:

    warpx   Bx/step_0/chunk_0                              step 0
    vpic    cbx/step_00040/chunk_0                         step 40
    lammps  position/step_0/chunk_0                        step 0
    nyx     plt00000/fab0000_comp00_density/chunk_0        dump 0 -> step 0

So Nyx's step has to be reconstructed as dump_index * interval, which is why
config.json's "interval" is read here rather than assumed. A cell whose names
do not parse is reported rather than silently given step 0.

DECOMPRESSION TIME IS NOT MEASURED FOR EVERY CHUNK. On WarpX only 53 of 240
rows carried a decompress_ms in the smoke run -- the codec is timed where the
runtime had reason to run it, not on every write. Decompression throughput is
therefore computed over the rows that HAVE it, and n_decompress_measured is
reported next to it so the denominator is never in doubt.

THROUGHPUT IS BYTES-IN OVER TIME, both directions. For compression that is the
uncompressed input over the compress kernel time; for decompression it is the
same uncompressed size over the decompress time, because that is the volume
the codec had to produce. Reporting compressed bytes per second instead would
make a better ratio look like worse throughput.

    Upstream computes exactly this (diagnostics_store.hpp:337-343) and does not

    (:347-348). Clio has neither, so this is the missing half of the
    comparison -- the benchmark could say WHICH candidate the model got wrong
    but never BY HOW MUCH.

    THE SOURCE IS explore.csv, NOT selection.csv, and that is the whole
    correctness argument. A prediction and a measurement may only be compared
    when they describe the SAME ACTION. selection.csv's primary row carries the
    model's prediction for the PRIMARY action while its adopted row carries the
    measurement for the ADOPTED one -- different actions whenever exploration
    overrode, which is 20-89% of chunks. Pairing those would report the model's
    error against a codec it never predicted. explore.csv has both halves on
    one row, per candidate.

    mape_of is upstream's, including its degenerate branch: it returns 0 --
    "perfect prediction" -- whenever the MEASURED value is <= 1e-6. That is a
