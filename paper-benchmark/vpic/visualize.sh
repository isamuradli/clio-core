#
# ONLY THE FIGURES ARE KEPT. Sixteen variables at 25 frames is gigabytes of
# .f32 that this script regenerates in a minute, so the dumps go to a scratch
# directory and are deleted when the render finishes. `--keep-dumps` puts them
# in ./fields-viz and leaves them.
#
# NOT `fields/`, which gen_fields.sh defaults to and run_sweep.sh reads: that
# directory is WIPED on entry to gen_fields.sh, so rendering into it would
# silently destroy a sweep's input.
#
# --ncell DEFAULTS TO 64 HERE, NOT THE BENCHMARK'S 126. The benchmark needs 126
# because the ghost layer makes the dumped extent (N+2)^3 and 126 gives exactly
# 128^3 voxels = 8 MiB per variable, which is a chunk-count property and means
# nothing to a picture. 126 costs ~130 s of simulation and 3.2 GB of dumps
# against 64's few seconds; pass --ncell 126 when the montage has to be of the
# benchmarked run itself.
#
# CLEAN DIVERGENCE CLEANING IS WHAT MAKES FOUR OF THESE PANELS MOVE. At
# upstream's clean_div_e_interval = 0, div_e_err, div_b_err, rhob and rhof are
# never recomputed, so a quarter of every montage is a still image. gen_fields.sh
# now defaults the interval to 10; see "Default Evolving Benchmark
# Configuration" in README.md. rhob stays constant at any setting -- this deck
# is vacuum and accumulates no bound charge -- so its panel is a still image on
# purpose.
