# --f64 replays .f64 dumps (a double Nyx build with NYX_DUMP_NATIVE=1) instead
# of .f32. The element width is the point of that control: the byte shuffle has
# to match it, so the same physics at both widths is what shows the stride
# actually matters rather than the dataset happening to prefer one.
#
# Replays the field dumps gen_fields.sh produced. Configurations differ only in
# how a codec is chosen per chunk -- identical to the LAMMPS benchmark's, so the
# two workloads are directly comparable:
#
#   dynamic        NeuroPress inference, default balanced cost model
#   dynamic-ratio  same, latency weights zeroed (ratio-only objective)
#   learn          dynamic + online SGD from measured outcomes
#   learn-ratio    learn, latency weights zeroed -- online SGD against a
#                  ratio-only objective. The learning arm's second half:
#                  `learn` trains on the balanced cost, this one on the
#                  same measurements scored purely by bytes saved.
#   explore        ratio-only ranking, top-K alternatives measured, winner kept

#   static-zstd    fixed nvcomp-zstd, no shuffle
#   static-zstd-s4 fixed nvcomp-zstd + 4-byte shuffle -- the stride matching
#                  VPIC's float32 fields
#   static-zstd-s8 fixed nvcomp-zstd + 8-byte shuffle -- the mismatched stride,
#                  included because a shuffle claim that only holds on
#                  compressible data is not a claim about the element width

# --- Cost-model bandwidth, error bound, exploration policy ----------------
# BW is CLIO_NEUROPRESS_COST_BW in BYTES PER MILLISECOND -- the unit of
# RankingWeights::bandwidth_bytes_per_ms (predictor.h), NOT bytes/s or GB/s.
# 1 GB/s = 1e6 B/ms; the shipped default 5e6 is 5 GB/s. It enters the cost as
# bytes/(ratio*bw), so it only changes a DECISION when some other term is
# non-zero -- under the ratio-only weights it is a positive scalar on the sole
# term and cannot reorder candidates at all. See ../BENCHMARK.md.
#
# EB is CLIO_NEUROPRESS_ERROR_BOUND, an ABSOLUTE bound: |orig - decoded| <= EB.
# 0 (empty) is lossless and masks NeuroPress's 16 quantize actions.
#
# THRESH_OPT=0 makes exploration UNCONDITIONAL. That is deliberate for this
# benchmark and not upstream's 0.5: at 0.5 a chunk explores only when the cost
# prediction was already off by >50%, so (a) the number of explored chunks
# varies with the cost model and bandwidth being compared, and (b) it varies
# run to run on a non-bit-reproducible workload -- measured 16/45 then 33/45
# on the same LAMMPS settings. Both make the 2x2 matrix less comparable.
# At 0 nearly every chunk explores, so nearly every compressed chunk yields a
# measured decompression time and the only variable left is the one under test.
#
# NEARLY, not every: the gate is `error_pct > threshold`, STRICT, and it is
# upstream's own (gpucompress_compress.cpp:733). A chunk whose cost the model
# predicted EXACTLY right has error_pct == 0 and does not explore at any
# threshold, 0 included. That is rare under the balance weights and common
# under the ratio ones, because ratio-only cost is bytes/(min(ratio,100)*bw)
# and nothing else: once the predicted AND actual ratio both clear the 100x
# cap the two costs are the same number, so the model is "exactly right" by
# arithmetic rather than by accuracy. Measured on Nyx 128^3, explore-ratio:
# 56 of 120 chunks lossless and 97 of 120 lossy never explored. Read
# `explored` in summary.csv rather than assuming full coverage.
# K stays at 3, NeuroPress's own ranked window.
