#
# ONLY THE FIGURES ARE KEPT. A 1,000-step run at the default diagnostic
# interval writes ~2 GB of openPMD plus the compressed tier, all of it
# regenerable by this script, so it goes to a scratch directory and is deleted
# when the render finishes. `--keep-dumps` puts it in ./run-viz and leaves it.
#
# NOTHING NEEDS DUMPING HERE, unlike the other three workloads: WarpX writes
# openPMD-HDF5 exactly as it always does and the VOL compresses on the way past,
# so the native .h5 the viewer reads are the same bytes the compressor saw.
#
# --stage-h2d IS NOT OPTIONAL. A stock WarpX hands HDF5 host memory and
# CLIO_NEUROPRESS_REQUIRE_DEVICE defaults on, so without it every chunk is
# refused and run_config.sh fails the run. See BENCHMARK.md section 3b.
#
# THE GRID CANNOT BE SHRUNK TO MAKE THIS QUICK. At 64x64x128 a field is 512 KB
# against the 1 MiB chunk, so no chunk completes and ZERO field bytes reach the
# tier -- while the run exits 0 and the native .h5 is perfect. 64x64x512 is the
# smallest grid that stages anything, so --steps is the only knob that makes a
# run shorter.
