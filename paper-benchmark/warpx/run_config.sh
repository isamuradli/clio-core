#   ./run_config.sh <config> [--ncell "NX NY NZ"] [--steps N] [--interval N]
#                            [--chunk BYTES] [--results DIR] [--tag NAME]

#
# --e-max and --density are the deck's physics, reaching it as ParmParse
# overrides. Defaults are the operating point the 1,000-step evolution study
# chose -- e_max 32e12 (a0 = 8), density upstream's 2e23. See "Default Evolving
# Benchmark Configuration" in README.md.
#
# --verify runs read.sh afterwards: reads field datasets back through the VOL
# from a separate process and requires BOTH that the bytes match a native read
# AND that the trace shows the tier served them. See read.sh for why the second
# half is not optional here.
#
# Unlike the other three workloads, nothing is dumped and replayed: a STOCK,
# UNPATCHED WarpX runs, writes openPMD-HDF5 as it always does, and HDF5 loads
# Clio's VOL connector because HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR says so. Clio's runtime is
# hosted in the WarpX process. Each policy is therefore its own WarpX run.
#
# Policies are the same set the other workloads use, so the numbers compare.
#
# RATIO_CAP=<x> overrides NeuroPress's ratio ceiling (default 100, upstream's
# nn_gpu.cu constant). It is worth knowing what it does to SELECTION, not just
# to ranking: the cost the exploration gate compares is
# bytes/(min(ratio,cap)*bw), so when a chunk's predicted AND actual ratio both
# exceed the cap the two costs are numerically identical, the error is exactly
# zero, and exploration cannot fire at any threshold -- including 0.
#
# CLIO_VOL_CHUNK_SIZE: 1 MiB here, NOT the 4 MiB the other workloads use, and
# this is not a tuning preference -- it is a correctness condition for this
# writer. openPMD emits each AMReX box as a separate partial write, so an
# 8 MiB field arrives as 1 MiB pieces at NON-CONTIGUOUS offsets ([0,1M) then
# [4M,5M) ...). The VOL's append path assembles only contiguous runs and drops
# the tail on a discontinuity, so with a 4 MiB chunk NO chunk ever completes and
# ZERO field bytes reach the tier -- while the run succeeds, the native .h5 is
# perfect, and nothing reports a problem. Measured: 0 field blobs staged at
# 4 MiB, 400 at 1 MiB. The chunk must be <= the writer's contiguous granularity.

# --- Cost-model bandwidth, error bound, exploration policy ----------------
# BW is CLIO_NEUROPRESS_COST_BW in BYTES PER MILLISECOND -- the unit of
# RankingWeights::bandwidth_bytes_per_ms (predictor.h), NOT bytes/s or GB/s.
# 1 GB/s = 1e6 B/ms; the shipped default 5e6 is 5 GB/s. It enters the cost as
# bytes/(ratio*bw), so it only changes a DECISION when some other term is
# non-zero -- under the ratio-only weights it is a positive scalar on the sole
# term and cannot reorder candidates at all. See ../BENCHMARK.md.
#
# EB is CLIO_NEUROPRESS_ERROR_BOUND, an ABSOLUTE bound: |orig - decoded| <= EB.
# 0 (empty) is lossless and masks NeuroPress's 16 quantize actions.
#
# THRESH_OPT=0 makes exploration UNCONDITIONAL. That is deliberate for this
# benchmark and not upstream's 0.5: at 0.5 a chunk explores only when the cost
# prediction was already off by >50%, so (a) the number of explored chunks
# varies with the cost model and bandwidth being compared, and (b) it varies
# run to run on a non-bit-reproducible workload -- measured 16/45 then 33/45
# on the same LAMMPS settings. Both make the 2x2 matrix less comparable.
# At 0 nearly every chunk explores, so nearly every compressed chunk yields a
# measured decompression time and the only variable left is the one under test.
#
# NEARLY, not every: the gate is `error_pct > threshold`, STRICT, and it is
# upstream's own (gpucompress_compress.cpp:733). A chunk whose cost the model
# predicted EXACTLY right has error_pct == 0 and does not explore at any
# threshold, 0 included. That is rare under the balance weights and common
# under the ratio ones, because ratio-only cost is bytes/(min(ratio,100)*bw)
# and nothing else: once the predicted AND actual ratio both clear the 100x
# cap the two costs are the same number, so the model is "exactly right" by
# arithmetic rather than by accuracy. Measured on Nyx 128^3, explore-ratio:
# 56 of 120 chunks lossless and 97 of 120 lossy never explored. Read
# `explored` in summary.csv rather than assuming full coverage.
# K stays at 3, NeuroPress's own ranked window.
# GPU-ONLY mode, in the only shape this workload can have it.
#
# A stock WarpX hands HDF5 HOST memory (measured -- see clio_stage_append's
# report), and openPMD emits non-contiguous partial writes the VOL assembles
# into a host run buffer, so residency is gone before Clio is called. Unlike
# Nyx/VPIC/LAMMPS there is no device pointer to hand over.
#
# So this takes UPSTREAM's route for a host-resident caller: stage the chunk
# H2D and run the same CUDA kernels on it. That is what
# gpucompress_compress() does -- "Transfers data to GPU, compresses, and
# returns result to host" -- and it keeps the guarantee that every transform
# runs in CUDA, which is the property being enforced. It costs a full H2D per
# chunk, real bandwidth the in-situ workloads do not spend, so WarpX timings
# are NOT comparable with theirs; the ratios are.
#
# REQUIRE_DEVICE stays on beneath it, so if staging ever fails to produce a
# device pointer the run refuses rather than silently reverting.
