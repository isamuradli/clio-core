# Phase 1 of 2: run Nyx and dump its raw fields as flat float32 files.
#
#   ./gen_fields.sh [--ncell N] [--steps N] [--plot-int N] [--stop-time T]
#                   [--exp-energy E] [--cfl X] [--out DIR] [--keep-plt]
#
# --keep-plt keeps Nyx's own AMReX plotfiles, in <out>-plotfiles. They are
# thrown away by default: the sweep never reads them, and at 128^3 they cost
# more than the dumps do. Ask for them when you want to LOOK at the run --
# they carry the sim time and the derived fields (pressure, Temp) the raw
# dumps do not, and yt/VisIt/ParaView open them natively. ../plot/viz_fields.py
# takes --plt <out>-plotfiles to label frames by time instead of by index.
#
# A SIBLING of <out>, deliberately, not a directory inside it. run_config.sh
# measures the payload with `du -sb $FIELDS` and counts frames with
# `ls $FIELDS | grep -c ^plt` -- a plotfiles/ directory in there would inflate
# the first and, since "plotfiles" itself matches ^plt, add one to the second.
#
# Nyx is an AMReX application with no library interface to embed, so -- exactly
# as upstream NeuroPress's own Nyx benchmark does -- the simulation is patched
# to dump raw fields, and the compression sweep replays those files offline.
# See patches/nyx-raw-field-dump.patch; it adds one self-contained function and
# links nothing.
#
# The Sedov blast wave is the workload upstream recommends: a point explosion
# into uniform background, so the data starts almost perfectly compressible and
# gets progressively less so as the shock expands. That spread is the point --
# it gives the selector genuinely different chunks within one run.
#
# HOW FAR THE SHOCK GETS is what decides whether the data evolves at all, and
# the default (200 steps, reaching t=0.005) leaves most of the box untouched.
# Sedov-Taylor gives R(t) = 1.033 (E t^2/rho)^(1/5) for this deck's rho=1, and
# a 61440 B chunk of a 128^3 field is essentially one z-slab, so a chunk is
# touched only once the shock reaches its z:
#
#     steps   t        E    R      z swept   blocks bit-identical between dumps
#      200    0.005   1.0  0.124     25%       91% -> 62%      (the default)
#     2600    0.113   3.0  0.533    100%       66% ->  0%
#
# Measured on density at 128^3: the DEFAULT deck leaves 62-91% of blocks
# BIT-IDENTICAL between consecutive dumps for the whole run -- E is exactly 0
# for more than half the domain at every dump, and the median block never
# changes at all. Keep that when you want a mix of frozen and active chunks,
# which is what makes the selector see genuinely different work; raise --steps
# when you want the whole domain live.
#
# NOT --exp-energy, if the run is ended by --steps. R ~ E^(1/5) is a statement
# about TIME, and a stronger blast shrinks the CFL timestep by exactly the
# factor it speeds the shock up, so at a fixed step count the two cancel: the
# 1,000-step study measured E = 1, 10 and 100 as indistinguishable (last-decile
# cells-identical 76.3 / 76.2 / 76.0%) while --cfl 0.5 -> 0.8 moved it to 53.2%.
# --exp-energy is the right knob only when stop_time is what ends the run. See
# "Default Evolving Benchmark Configuration" in README.md.
#
# stop_time DEFAULTS HIGH SO --steps IS THE CONTROL. Both bound the run; only
# one of them should be doing the work, and step count is what --plot-int is
# expressed in. Pass --stop-time only if you want a time-terminated run.
#
# NOTE: reaching these times at all needs the second patch,
# patches/nyx-comoving-a-single-precision-eps.patch. Without it Nyx aborts with
# "get_comoving_a: invalid time" partway in -- an eps in get_comoving_a() that
# underflows a float ULP in the AMReX_PRECISION=SINGLE build this benchmark
# uses. It aborts AFTER writing each dump, so the symptom is a nonzero exit
# with seemingly complete output. See the patch header for the full analysis.
#
# Phase 2 is run_sweep.sh, which replays whatever this produced.
