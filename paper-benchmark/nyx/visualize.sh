# ONLY THE FIGURES ARE KEPT. The dumps behind them are ~4 GB at the default
# settings -- 1.3 GB of .f32 and 2.8 GB of AMReX plotfiles -- and they are
# regenerable from this script in under a minute, so they go to a scratch
# directory and are deleted when the render finishes. `--keep-dumps` puts them
# in ./fields-viz instead and leaves them, for when you want to sweep or
# re-slice the same bytes.
#
# NOT `fields/`, which gen_fields.sh defaults to and run_sweep.sh reads: that
# directory is WIPED on entry to gen_fields.sh, so rendering into it would
# silently destroy a sweep's input. A sweep and a montage also want different
# frame counts -- a sweep wants few large frames because its chunk count is the
# point, a montage is unreadable much past ~26.
#
# ZMOM IS SLICED ON x, NOT z, AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC. A vector component is
# antisymmetric about the mid-plane normal to its own axis, so z-momentum is ~0
# across the whole z mid-plane by symmetry and the montage comes out blank while
# the field is perfectly healthy. Measured at 128^3, frame 20: zmom reaches 4.24
# globally and 0.048 on the z mid-plane, against xmom's 4.23 on that same plane.
# Same trap as the Fortran-ordering one in ../plot/viz_fields.py, same silence.
